# Sitting Plan

> This page is only the Front-end part of the project.This project was developed using the Vue.js framework.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

>This project has been prepared for the planning of which table and chair on which floor the working people will sit.

+ At first we come across the main page is the floor list. 

+ If you click on the new button you can add a new floor to the system. If you click on an existing floor, you will be redirected to the next page, the table list.

+ If you click on the new button here you can create a new table. 

+ Clicking on an existing table will take you to the page with the chair list.

+ If you click on the empty section of the chair page, you can add new employees to that chair. 

+ If you click on the employee name, you can remove that employee from the chair.

+ If you click on the "çalışan ekle" section at the top of the page, if you add employee to the system, the employee you have added here will not sit in any chair at the beginning.
